# Shear-Force-and-Bending-Moment-Diagram-Calculator
A Python-based tool that models a statically determinate beam with one smooth-pin (hinge) support and one roller/rocker support. Users input beam length and load configurations (point or distributed), and the program computes support reactions, internal shear forces, and bending momentsâ€”then plots clear shear-force and bending-moment diagrams.
